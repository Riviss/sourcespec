abstract: "SourceSpec is a collection of command line tools to compute earthquake source
  parameters (seismic moment, corner frequency, radiated energy, source size, stress drop)
  from the inversion of P-wave and S-wave displacement spectra recorded at one or more
  seismic stations. SourceSpec also computes attenuation parameters (t-star, quality factor)
  and, as a bonus, local magnitude."
